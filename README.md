# Stop the Infection!

Made by **RangerRhino23**!

Stop the Infection! This world is being destroyed by a green virus that spreads. Get close to and destroy the green goo as quick as you can!

This game was created during a fun game competition where Itsbailey and me had to create a game with a theme in 2 hours. The game theme was "Its Spreading!"
